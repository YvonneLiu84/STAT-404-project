proposal requirments
Your team submits a one-page proposal with objectives, experimental factors and their levels, the response variable (including how it will be measured if not obvious), and an outline of the tentative experimental plan and analysis.
By that date we will have just started the part of the course on planning experiments, including fractional-factorial plans to cut down the number of observations required. The latter methodology could be of interest to you, as it could save time. Hence, the ex- perimental plan is “tentative”; it will be okay to change the plan shortly after as you learn more. All you really need for the proposal is a good idea of the factors you will be investigating, how you will make measurements, and your objectives.
Your team is encouraged to discuss ideas with me or a TA before submitting the proposal.
